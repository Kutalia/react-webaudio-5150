# Faust Web Audio Library Exemples


This folder contains exemples of use of the Faust Web Audio Library.

Exemples prefixed with `aw-` require Audio Worklet support.
All the other exemples are supposed to run using any recent browser except Internet Explorer.
See [Audio Nodes Instances](../README.md) section for more details on audio architectures.

To get sound, some browsers might require a user interaction with the page (notably Safari),
just click anywhere if you don't hear anything.
